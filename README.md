# Examining the relationship of UK stock exchange and public sentiment

This repository contains part of the code I wrote for my dissertation, presented for my postgraduate degree. 
</br> For this project, I gathered both social media data related to the Covid-19 pandemic and financial data to examine the relationship of the UK stock exchange and the public sentiment in the light of a crisis. The data were pre-processed and converted to time-series and Python was used for sentiment analysis, Granger causality analysis, and predictive modelling.
